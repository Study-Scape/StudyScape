Project status (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)
- Goals for the week. The first subsection is easy. It should be an exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week. 
- Progress and issues. The second subsection should report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are blocked.
- Goals for next week. The third subsection should outline your plans and goals for the following week. Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate (no longer than a week). If tasks from one week aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week with an updated estimate for time to completion. For the project status, this third subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.

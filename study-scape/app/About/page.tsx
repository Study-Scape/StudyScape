        <p className="text-gray-600">This project aims to identify, evaluate, and share detailed information about studying spots on and around the University of Washington campus, providing students with a comprehensive resource to optimize their study experience. Each study location is assessed based on key factors such as the hours of operation, walking distance from central areas, outlet availability, nearby restrooms, and food and drink options. Additionally, the project evaluates each locationâ€™s capacity constraints, noise level, and accessibility limitations. Reviews and ratings from students, along with photographs, are provided to offer a clear and relatable perspective of each space from reliable sources. Overall, this project seeks to empower university students to make informed decisions about where to study based on their preferences and needs.

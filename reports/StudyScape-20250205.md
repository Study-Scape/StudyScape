# Study Scape Status Report 2/05/2025

## Project Status

### Meeting Agenda

### Goals for the week
We hope to finalize our chosen software and tools for the project.
- Each subteam will be responsible for justifying and making their choices.  
  
All members will explore and research their roles/subteams.

### Progress and issues
We finished the architecture and design assignment successfully and have a good picture on what our techstack will be (React, MapBox, Supabase).

### Goals for next week
Have MapBox, React, and Supabase set up individually and hopefully ready to integrate.

## Individual Status

### Goals for the week
- Brandon: 
  - Establish and agree on architecture and text stack for the app  
- Michael:  
  - Work on and finish architecture assignment. Should take less than a week (since it's due).  
  - Begin research on Google Maps API (the time estimate is unknown, just however long it takes).
- Sanjana:
  - complete architecture and design assignment by next week
  - research more about software to implement design
- Carl:
  - Familiarize with the top potential tools and techstack (~3 days)
  - Practice using said tools (~2 days)
- Julie:
  - complete 03 assignment for next week's due date (~4 days)
  - talk about what should the frontend have (~4 days)
- Dawn:
  - work with Carl to determine potential tools and tech stack (~3 days)
  - practice using said tools (~3 days)

### Progress and issues
- Dawn: Worked on architecture and design document. Starting to read up on Supabase and PostgreSQL documentation (have never used these before). Supabase does have React support but not MapBox support so we'll need to figure out exactly how we expect MapBox and Supabase to communicate if at all.

### Goals for next week
- Dawn: Have Supabase fully set up and functional to receive and store data, or at least have the former done and start to do testing for the latter (~4 days)

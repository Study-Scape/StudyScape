# StudyScape
CSE 403 Project Description: 
- This project aims to identify, evaluate, and share detailed information about
studying spots on and around the University of Washington campus, providing students
with a comprehensive resource to optimize their study experience. Each study location is
assessed based on key factors such as the hours of operation, walking distance from
central areas, outlet availability, nearby restrooms, and food and drink options.
Additionally, the project evaluates each locationâ€™s capacity constraints, noise level, and
accessibility limitations. Reviews and ratings from students, along with photographs, are
provided to offer a clear and relatable perspective of each space from reliable sources.
Overall, this project seeks to empower university students to make informed decisions
about where to study based on their preferences and needs.
